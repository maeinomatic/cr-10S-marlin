# cr-10S-marlin
custom marlin configuration for the Creality CR-10S for the 4.2.7 board with TMC 2225 stepper drivers (in Marlin settings it's TMC2208).

The Z Axis had to be inverted for me, probably because of the dual Z axis adapter i used.

No bl-touch in this one. If you want to use that for bed leveling, you have to compile the firmware yourself. Use the ender 3 or cr-10 example config on the official marlin github for reference.
